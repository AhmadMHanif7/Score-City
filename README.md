PURPOSE:
Score City is a statistic website that gathers potential odds between two futball(soccer) teams. Score city also is a website that updates the latest team news so that fans from anywhere in the world can be up to day with their team. As a user, I want to know the likelihood of my favorite team winning compared to another team. This can be used to ease the nerve or amplify the superstition.
